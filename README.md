#Profile

I’m a statistician by profession and a programmer by hobby with a Master’s Degree in Business Analytics. With more than 10 years of professional experience my main interests are in the field of Data Science and Data engineering particularly in recommendation systems, time series analysis and CI/CD data pipelines. I’m looking to improve my knowledge in advanced modeling tools like ensemble, deep learning and Big Data.
